## üåü What is Desktop Commander?

Desktop Commander transforms AI from a chatbot into a **powerful system operator** with:

‚ö° **Terminal Control** - Execute commands directly on your system  
üìÅ **File System Access** - Search, read, write, and edit files anywhere  
‚úÇÔ∏è **Surgical Edits** - Make precise changes with diff-based editing  
üîç **Code Analysis** - Explore and understand complex codebases  
ü§ñ **Full Automation** - Automate tasks across your entire OS  

**Key Difference**: Unlike IDE-focused tools (Cursor, Windsurf), Desktop Commander works with your **entire OS**, not just within a coding environment.

---

## üìÅ Configuration

Your `.cursor/mcp.json` now includes:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "desktop-commander"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Auto-updates enabled!** Desktop Commander automatically updates when you restart Cursor.

## üöÄ Core Capabilities

### 1. **Terminal Control** üñ•Ô∏è

Execute any command directly on your system:

```
Run 'gradlew assembleDebug' to build the Android app
Execute 'adb devices' to list connected devices
Run 'git status' and tell me what files changed
```

**Safety Features**:
- Requires explicit permission for dangerous commands
- Shows command output in real-time
- Handles both foreground and background processes

### 2. **File System Search** üîç

Find files and code patterns across your project:

```
Search for all Kotlin files that use 'Composable'
Find files containing 'QuestRepository'
List all XML files in the res directory
```

**Advanced Search**:
- Fast fuzzy search across large codebases
- Filter by file type, directory, or content
- Works with multiple projects simultaneously

### 3. **Surgical File Editing** ‚úÇÔ∏è

Make precise changes with diff-based editing:

```
In StatusScreen.kt, change the stat level calculation to use logarithmic scaling
Update the QuestRepository to add caching for frequent queries
Refactor the CRTEffect composable to improve performance
```

**Benefits**:
- Changes are atomic (all or nothing)
- Shows exactly what will change before applying
- Works with large files efficiently
- Preserves formatting and style

### 4. **Codebase Exploration** üó∫Ô∏è

Understand complex projects:

```
Analyze the architecture of the Pip-Droid app
Explain how the Quest Log syncs with Google Calendar
Show me the data flow from QuestRepository to QuestLogScreen
```

**Intelligence**:
- Reads full files (not chunks like some tools)
- Understands project structure
- Tracks dependencies and relationships

### 5. **Multi-Project Work** üìÇ

Work across multiple projects simultaneously:

```
Compare the MVVM implementation between Pip-Droid and my other app
Copy the CRT effects from this project to my new launcher
Sync the database schema between the app and domain modules
```

## üîê Security & Safety

### **Permission System**

Desktop Commander asks for permission before:
- Executing potentially dangerous commands
- Modifying system files
- Accessing sensitive directories
- Running scripts with elevated privileges

### **Safe Defaults**

- Commands run in your current working directory by default
- File edits show diff preview before applying
- Atomic operations (all changes succeed or fail together)
- Local usage analytics (never sent externally by default)

### **Privacy**

Desktop Commander collects **minimal anonymous telemetry**:
- ‚úÖ Local usage stats (always stored locally)
- ‚úÖ Tool call counts and success rates
- ‚ùå NO file contents
- ‚ùå NO file paths
- ‚ùå NO command arguments

**Disable External Telemetry**:
```
Disable telemetry
```

## üíé Pro Tips

### **1. Combine with Other MCP Servers**

```
"Generate a mockup with @pollinations-image, then use it as reference 
 to implement the UI with precise layout dimensions"
```

### **2. Use Natural Language**

‚ùå Don't: "execute_command('gradlew assembleDebug')"  
‚úÖ Do: "Build the debug APK"

### **3. Let AI Read Full Context**

```
"Read all files in the quest feature module and explain the architecture"
```

Desktop Commander reads full files, not chunks - it understands complete context.

### **4. Leverage Multi-Project**

```
"Compare the navigation implementation between Pip-Droid 
 and my other project at ~/projects/mynewapp"
```

### **5. Automate Repetitive Tasks**

```
"Create a script that builds, installs, and launches the app with one command"
```

### **6. Use Surgical Edits for Large Files**

```
"In the 2000-line MainActivity.kt, update only the onCreate method 
 to add analytics tracking"
```

Shows minimal diff, precise change.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Desktop Commander Not Available

**Symptoms**: `@desktop-commander` doesn't appear  
**Solutions**:
1. Restart Cursor completely
2. Check Node.js: `node --version` (v16+ required)
3. Verify `.cursor/mcp.json` configuration
4. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

### Issue 2: Commands Fail to Execute

**Symptoms**: Terminal commands return errors  
**Solutions**:
- Check working directory: "What's my current directory?"
- Verify command exists: "Check if gradle is installed"
- Review permissions: Commands may need admin/sudo
- Check command syntax: Ensure proper escaping

### Issue 3: File Edits Don't Apply

**Symptoms**: Changes shown in diff but not applied  
**Solutions**:
- Check file permissions (read/write access)
- Ensure file isn't locked by another process
- Verify file path is correct
- Review diff for conflicts

### Issue 4: Slow Performance

**Symptoms**: Commands take long time to execute  
**Solutions**:
- Large file searches can be slow - be more specific
- Terminal commands with lots of output may delay
- Consider breaking complex operations into steps
- Check system resources (CPU, memory)

---

## üìä Usage Analytics

Desktop Commander tracks local usage statistics for your benefit:

```
Show me my usage stats
```

**See**:
- Total commands executed
